//! Route resolution: which provider actually serves a given model.
//!
//! A logical model (`kling-3.0`) has an ordered list of routes, each naming a
//! provider and the slug that provider knows it by. The resolver picks the
//! first route the user holds a key for, unless they pinned one or asked for
//! the cheapest.
//!
//! Higgsfield's internal model ids are byte-for-byte fal slugs minus the
//! `fal-ai/` prefix, which is why the fal column of this table reads like a
//! copy of theirs. That is the single largest saving available to us and the
//! reason fal anchors the roster.
