//! Input media: what the user attached, and which wire field it becomes.
//!
//! This is the layer that makes image-to-video possible, which matters because
//! i2v is the dominant mode — Higgsfield's own empty state reads
//! *ADD IMAGE → CHOOSE PRESET → GET VIDEO*. A generator that only does
//! text-to-video is a different, much smaller product.
//!
//! Two problems are solved here and they are genuinely separate:
//!
//! 1. **Binding.** The user thinks in roles ("this is my start frame"). The
//!    provider thinks in flags (`start_image`, `image`, `image_references`).
//!    Which flag a role lands in depends on the model: a model with no
//!    `start_image` flag but a plain `image` flag still does i2v perfectly
//!    well, and refusing it because the exact flag is missing would be wrong.
//!
//! 2. **Reach.** Most providers need a *public URL*, not bytes. Resolving a
//!    local file into something the provider can fetch is [`Uploader`]'s job,
//!    kept behind a trait so the binding logic above is testable without a
//!    network and so each provider's upload endpoint can differ.
//!
//! The flag names are not invented. They are the ones in the vendored MIT
//! `MODELS.md`, by frequency: `image` (32 models), `image_references` (32),
//! `start_image` (19), `end_image` (13), `video` (10), `video_references` (8),
//! `audio` (8), `audio_references` (8).
