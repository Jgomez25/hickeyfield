//! The model registry: catalogue specs joined to routes and per-route prices.
//!
//! [`crate::catalog`] answers "what does this model accept". This module answers
//! the two questions that make a model usable: **who serves it** and **what will
//! it cost me**. Those are separate axes — the same logical model is a different
//! price on fal than on Vercel AI Gateway, sometimes by 2x — so cost is stored
//! per route, never per model.
//!
//! Three sources feed it, in this order:
//!
//! 1. the vendored `MODELS.md` spec (flags, defaults, constraints),
//! 2. the route table from the research plan §3.2 plus the per-model price rows
//!    in §2.1/§2.2 and `gap-1.md`,
//! 3. hand-authored specs for the models in Higgsfield's *live picker* that
//!    their own CLI spec omits.
//!
//! **Every USD figure here is transcribed from those documents.** Where a
//! provider publishes no price — several fal `pricingInfoOverride` fields are
//! literally blank — the entry is [`CostModel::Unknown`] and the resolver sorts
//! it behind anything priced. Guessing would be worse than admitting ignorance,
//! because the number goes straight onto the Generate button.
//!
//! **Route slugs are family roots.** A single Higgsfield model maps to one
//! endpoint per input mode on every provider (`/text-to-video`,
//! `/image-to-video`, `/reference-to-video`, …), and the input mode is not known
//! until the user has attached their media. The adapter appends the suffix; the
//! route names the family. Where the corpus never recorded a slug at all, the
//! route carries a note beginning `unverified slug` so the uncertainty reaches
//! the UI instead of dying in a comment.

/// *model id*, and nothing joined the two — so before this table existed there
/// was no way to obtain a [`JobType`] from a model the user had actually picked,
/// and the entire enhance subsystem was unreachable from a real generation.
///
/// Shape deliberately mirrors [`LAUNCH_FAMILIES`]: one row per job type listing
/// every model that resolves to it. Grouping this way rather than one row per
/// model is what makes the editorial calls legible — a model sitting in a family
/// it does not belong to is visible at a glance, where a flat 68-row list would
/// hide it.
///
/// It cannot be a bijection: Higgsfield's table has 26 job types and we route 68
/// models. Where the join is an identity the row is silent; where a model had no
/// job type of its own, the row says which one it borrows and why. **The choice
/// only ever changes a default** — [`crate::enhance::decide`] rule 3 hands the
/// prompt back to the user the moment they touch the toggle — so the cost of a
/// debatable row is one wrong initial toggle position, not a wrong generation.
///
/// Eleven job types match no model. That is the roster being smaller than their
/// product, not an omission here:
///
/// - `lipsync`, `photodump` and `fashion-factory` name surfaces `PARITY.md` §2a
///   lists as built-zero, as do `avatar` and `complex-avatar` under
///   Characters/identity. `animate` is image-to-animation; the nearest unbuilt
///   surface is Recast (Wan 2.2 Animate, §2a), though we have not confirmed the
///   two are the same thing. `scene` we cannot place at all — nothing in the
///   corpus we hold says which of their surfaces it belongs to, so it is left
///   unused rather than assigned on a guess.
/// - `image-wan2.2` is a Wan *image* model; the vendored spec lists no Wan model
///   under Image at all.
/// - `image-flux-2-flex` and `image-flux-2-max` are `--variant flex|max` on the
///   one `flux_2` entry, not separate ids.
/// - `image-gpt-image-2-mini` names a GPT Image 2 tier that appears neither in
