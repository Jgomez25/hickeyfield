//! What the user is trying to do, and which models can actually do it.
//!
//! The workspace tabs used to be *Create Video · Edit Video · Motion Control* —
//! Higgsfield's names, describing surfaces rather than jobs — and they filtered
//! nothing. Every model was offered under every tab, so you could sit in
//! "Edit Video", attach a clip, pick Gemini Omni, and be told after submitting
//! that it takes a prompt only.
//!
//! **The refusal was right and its timing was wrong.** A control that lets you
//! choose something impossible and explains afterwards has already wasted the
//! decision. The use case is the thing the user knows before anything else, so
//! it should be what narrows the roster.
//!
//! Filtering is deliberately *local* — no network. Drawing a picker must not
//! cost 68 HTTP requests, so this uses the measured mode table in
//! [`crate::media`] plus the no-media list below, and
//! [`crate::capability::for_route`] refines the single selected model
//! afterwards.
