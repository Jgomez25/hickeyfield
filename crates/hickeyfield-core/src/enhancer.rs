//! The prompt rewriter — the thing [`crate::enhance`] decides *whether* to run.
//!
//! [`crate::enhance`] settles the question "should this prompt be rewritten?"
//! and compiles structured settings into one string. It has never had anything
//! to hand that string to. This module is that thing, and it is the product's
//! differentiator: enhance rule 1 forces enhancement **on** whenever a real
//! preset is selected, *because the preset's aesthetic is delivered by the
//! rewrite*. Without a rewriter, every preset ships its name and none of its
//! effect.
//!
//! Three commitments shape the whole file:
//!
//! 1. **A failed rewrite must never block a generation, and must never look
//!    like a successful one.** Enhancement is an optional improvement on the
//!    submit path. If Ollama is down or a key has expired, the user's original
//!    prompt is submitted — with a reason attached, so the UI can say so.
//!    [`enhance_or_original`] is the funnel that makes that true even for an
//!    [`Enhancer`] implementation that returns `Err`.
//! 2. **Both prompts survive.** [`Rewritten`] carries the new text *and* the
//!    original, so the composer can show both and the user can always see what
//!    was actually sent. Higgsfield shows you neither.
//! 3. **The rewrite is auditable.** [`Enhancer::version`] is recorded per
//!    generation and includes a digest of the system prompt, because changing
//!    the corpus changes the output — two generations recorded under the same
//!    version must have been produced the same way.
//!
//! ## The system prompt is not in this file
//!
//! Every constructor takes the system prompt as a `&str`. The text lives in the
//! `prompts/` corpus, not in Rust: it is content, it will be edited far more
//! often than this code, and burying it in a string literal would mean shipping
//! a binary to change a comma. A blank system prompt is refused rather than sent
//! — an enhancer wired up before the corpus loaded would otherwise produce
//! plausible-looking garbage that nobody could trace back to a missing file.
//!
//! That corpus is a base file plus **exactly one** mode overlay. [`mode_for`]
//! picks the overlay from the request and [`assemble_system_prompt`] refuses to
//! join a missing half, because the base file alone reads as a complete
//! instruction set while having no mode discipline at all.
//!
//! ## What the rewriter is given, and what it gives back
//!
//! One slot, not the whole prompt. [`EnhanceRequest::prompt`] is
//! [`crate::enhance::PromptParts::scene`] — what the user typed — and
//! [`Rewritten::prompt`] replaces it, after which the caller re-runs
//! `PromptParts::compile()`. The camera clause, the preset clause and the
//! lighting/lens/mood clauses are composed by code around the result and are
//! never exposed to the model. This is what makes a mangled camera move
//! structurally impossible rather than merely discouraged.
//!
//! ## Wire formats
//!
//! All three were verified on 2026-08-05 rather than recalled:
//!
//! - **Ollama** `POST /api/chat` — probed live against a running daemon.
//!   Non-streaming returns `message.content`, plus `done_reason` (`"stop"`, or
//!   `"length"` when the reply was truncated). A missing model answers HTTP 404
//!   with `{"error": "model 'x' not found"}`.
//! - **OpenAI** `POST /v1/chat/completions` — path and `Authorization: Bearer`
//!   confirmed by an unauthenticated probe (401, not 404); body and response
//!   fields read from the published OpenAPI document. Note `max_tokens` is
//!   **deprecated there and rejected by the o-series**; the current field is
//!   `max_completion_tokens`. A safety decline arrives as HTTP 200 with
//!   `message.content: null` and `message.refusal` set.
//! - **Anthropic** `POST /v1/messages` — `x-api-key` plus
//!   `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`; `system` is a **top-level field**, not a
//!   message with `role: "system"`, and `max_tokens` is required. The reply is
//!   an array of content blocks, so the text must be found by `type == "text"`
//!   rather than read out of index 0 — a thinking block can come first.
//!
//! **No request sets `temperature`.** It is the single most portable-looking
//! parameter that is not portable: Anthropic's current models reject it with a
//! 400, and OpenAI's reasoning models reject any non-default value. Omitting it
//! costs nothing here — determinism was never available, and the system prompt
//! is where style belongs.
