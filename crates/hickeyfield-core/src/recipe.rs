//! Recipes: reading a request back off the wire, and writing one to a file.
//!
//! Everything in this module exists to answer one question the app could not
//! previously answer: *given a request body, what did the user actually ask
//! for?* Rerun, Recreate, "reuse these settings" and recipe import/export all
//! reduce to that, and all of them were blocked on it — the harness could only
//! go forwards.
//!
//! Two directions live here and they are deliberately not symmetric:
//!
//! - [`Inputs::to_provider`] mirrors `submit_to_provider` in the Tauri shell:
//!   media through [`media::bind`], then the prompt, then only the settings the
//!   model's own spec declares.
//! - [`from_provider`] inverts it, using the same two sources of truth — the
//!   [`ModelSpec`] for *which roles this model accepts* and the [`Dialect`] for
//!   *what the endpoint calls them*.
//!
//! ## Round-tripping is lossy by design
//!
//! `Inputs → to_provider → from_provider → Inputs` is **exact for everything
//! the model declares** and drops exactly what the provider would have rejected
//! anyway:
//!
//! - a setting the spec does not declare is dropped, because an unknown key is
//!   a 422 on several providers. `submit_to_provider` already drops it, so the
//!   key never reached the provider and is not part of the request the user
//!   made;
//! - a `null` setting is dropped, as the shell drops it: a null is the absence
//!   of a setting rather than a setting whose value is null;
//! - a prompt is dropped for a model that declares no `prompt` flag;
//! - an empty prompt comes back as `None`, because the wire carries no
//!   difference between "no prompt" and "the empty prompt".
//!
//! The other direction is tight, and it is the one Rerun depends on:
//! `body → from_provider → to_provider → body` reproduces the body **byte for
//! byte** for every key the model declares, whenever the body is one
//! [`Inputs::to_provider`] could have written. A re-run has to be the same
//! request, not a similar one — the user is paying for it again. A *hand*-
//! written body can spell a media key the way the catalogue documents it rather
//! than the way [`media::bind`] emits it; that still decodes to the right role,
//! and then re-emits in the binder's spelling, which is the one the endpoint
//! sees anyway. `role_for_key` explains why the two differ.
//!
//! One thing recovery cannot always restore is the *label* on a piece of media,
//! because [`media::bind`] itself does not always write one. fal spells both
//! [`MediaRole::Video`] and [`MediaRole::VideoReference`] `video_url`; and in a
//! body written in the catalogue's own vocabulary, a bare `image` is the flag
//! that both [`MediaRole::Start`] and [`MediaRole::Reference`] fall back to.
//! Recovery picks the first role in [`ROLE_ORDER`] that the model declares, so
//! the request still round-trips; only the name the UI puts under the thumbnail
//! can change.
