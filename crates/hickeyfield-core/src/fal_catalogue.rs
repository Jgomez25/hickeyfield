//! fal's whole catalogue, from fal.
//!
//! Until today the model roster was hand-transcribed from Higgsfield's public
//! surfaces into [`crate::registry`]: 68 models, typed out by a human, describing
//! *Higgsfield's* backend while every request we send goes to fal. Every bug
//! found on 2026-08-05 came from that inversion — wrong parameter names, wrong
//! endpoint splits, wrong accepted inputs. [`crate::fal_schema`] fixed the
//! per-endpoint half of it by reading fal's published OpenAPI instead of
//! guessing. This module fixes the other half: fal also publishes its *index*.
//!
//! `GET https://fal.ai/api/models?page=N` is unauthenticated and paged 40 to a
//! page. Measured on 2026-09-16: **38 pages, 1,491 live models** (1,418 on
//! 2026-08-05, so fal added 100 endpoints and retired 27 in six weeks — the
//! drift this module exists to absorb), each carrying
//! `id`, `title`, `category`, `shortDescription`, `pricingInfoOverride`,
//! `deprecated`, `removed`, `modelFamily` and `thumbnailUrl`. That is twenty
//! times the roster we had transcribed, it is authoritative for the provider we
//! actually call, and it costs one HTTP request to keep current.
//!
//! # What this module is not
//!
//! It is not a price feed. [`crate::prices`] owns the number that reaches the
//! Generate button and is deliberately stricter than this parser, because a
//! wrong figure there charges someone money. What [`Pricing`] gives you is what
//! fal *said*, reduced to a rate only where the sentence states one outright,
//! and kept as prose otherwise. Of the 730 models that publish pricing text,
//! 193 reduce to a rate and 537 stay prose — see [`parse_pricing`] for why the
//! remainder is refused rather than approximated.
//!
//! It is also not a route table. An id here is a fal endpoint, not proof that
//! Hickeyfield can drive it: that still comes from [`crate::registry`] and
//! [`crate::route`].
//!
//! # Offline first
//!
//! A snapshot of all 1,491 rows ships in the binary via `include_str!`, so the
//! first launch on a plane still lists models. [`refresh_in_background`] then
//! replaces it. [`Catalogue::captured`] records which of the two you are
//! looking at and when it was taken, because a roster from last month is only
//! honest if it says so.
//!
//! # Refreshing the snapshot
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p hickeyfield-core --example fal_diff -- --dump > \
//!   crates/hickeyfield-core/vendor/fal-catalogue-snapshot.json
//! cargo test -p hickeyfield-core fal_catalogue
//! ```
//!
//! The same example, run without `--dump`, prints what fal serves that
//! [`crate::registry`] has no route to — which is the question a refresh is
//! usually being run to answer.
//!
//! The tests assert on the counts measured at capture time, so a refresh that
//! changes the roster fails loudly rather than drifting. Update the expected
//! numbers in the same commit and the diff reads as "this is what fal added".
